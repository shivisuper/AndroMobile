##*TODO LIST*

NB:

* Recording image or video is allowable. You do not have to do both.
* Pictograms refer to icons (emoticons), not face recognition/processing
* For adding users, you can pick any 3 from username, address book, snapcode,
   nearby (Bluetooth or WiFi), social share username
* For Discover and Discover algorithm, you may prepopulate your server with some
   stories and have a simple algorithm that reorders them based on some
   information, e.g. previous user's clicks and similarity between stories.
* Use of web view within the app is allowable in a limited way, i.e. your entire
   app must not be just one big web view!
* We will work on this together and it's not like everyone is going to stick
   with their own 6 tasks. It just gives us peace of mind :P
* We will also have to discuss about some novel idea. But that can be done at
   the end when we completed everything else.
